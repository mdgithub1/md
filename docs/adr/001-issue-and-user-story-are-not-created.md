Date: 2021-10-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

User story and issue tasks will not be provided.

## Decision

- User story and issue tasks will not be provided as it brings an additional complexity to the simple test project. 
- Task will be highlighted in the bullet list in README.

## Consequences

- The history will be included in the commits and pull requests
- Poorly described PRs with no connection to the issue
- Issues will not have story points

**Risk**:  
- No user stories / issue tasks might bring an impression of wrong approach to the lifecycle task
