# Task

This task is meant to see how you would plan, execute, and document a new API. The example
below outlines a simple CRUD API for managing expenses. The API can be created in any
language/framework that you would like, but we would like to see how you document the API, how
you plan the database schema and an example of a flow diagram for the usage of it.

Return your project code to us as either as a zip file or in a public project hosted on Github or
BitBucket.

In case any thing is not clear, please make an assumption and document any assumptions in the
README file.

# Criteria

- The expenses should have:
    - A description of the expense
    - A value for the expense
    - Belong to a type of expense
- Type of expense should be one of the following:
    - Entertainment
    - Food
    - Bills
    - Transport
    - Other
- The API should handle:
    - Listing all expenses
    - Creation of a new expense
    - Reading a single expense
    - Update of an expense
    - Deletion of an expense
- The API can be created in your language/framework of choice
- The API should communicate with a database to persist the expenses (MySQL).
- The API should have unit/integration tests.
- The API should conform to RESTful standards and best practices.
- The API should have good error handling.
- No Frontend is required, this is only an API.
- The API should return json formatted data
- No authentication or user management is required
- No pagination is required
- Create a README file outlining how to run the API and the tests.
- Create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the database
- Create documentation for the API (E.g., Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Create an example Flow Chart of how a user could use the API (E.g. Listing the expenses,
  creating a new expense...)
